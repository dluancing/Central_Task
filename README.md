Central task
! I dont know much about programming so I had a task I wanted to complete in Central for a clinet. 
I found Joe Nevil's awesome video on how to change access-point names using Postman and APIs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixSyY-SgGyc&t=1s
I saw when playing around with Joe's examples that there is a way to turn off the dot11g radio
I have a client that wanted to turn off the dot11g radios in a warehouse but only at a particular site
All the access-points were in the same group but we could export the APs and only update the APs for this particular site
